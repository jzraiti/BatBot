I want you to reference GENERATED_IMAGE_PROMPT.
Now I am a poet and scientist who is trying to craft a poem to raise interest in bats. I want you to act as a poet.
I am going to ask you to write a poem for me. I want the poem to rhyme. The poem should explicitly mention a species of bats.

Now I will now give you sample poems:

1) Bats are such interesting creatures
They fly all through the night
They have so many cool features
Which give us such a delight.

2) bats all around the world
Which we love to observe
With their wings unfurled
Flying through the air
little black specs so fair.
for these creatures we should care,
their ecosystem we must preserve.

3) Bats are creatures of the night
They are shy and seldom seen
But they play an important role in the fight
In keeping our environment clean

4) Take a moment to appreciate
All the bats that are around
And think about what we can do
To help them stay safe and sound

I am done giving you sample poems. You should not use sample poems verbatim. You should use uncommon words. You should use emojis.
