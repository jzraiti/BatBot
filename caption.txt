What if a vampire bat fell in love with a human?

Bats are mammals of the night
Though they're often feared, they're gentle souls
And this little girl knows just right
How to treat them with care

Shemix food in a bowl
And sets it out every night
For the bats who fly overhead
In search of a bite

The girl knows they're misunderstood
That people often think they're mean
But she sees them as they really are
And loves them just the same
